2) OuterProduct: NumPy program to compute the outer product of two given vectors
3) CrossProduct: NumPy program to compute the cross product of two given vectors
4) Determinant: NumPy program to compute the determinant of a given square array
5) Summation: NumPy program to evaluate Einstein's summation convention of two given multidimensional arrays
6) InnerProduct: NumPy program to compute the inner product of vectors for 1-D arrays (without complex conjugation) and in higher dimension
7) Eigenvalues: NumPy program to compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given square array
8) Kronecker: NumPy program to compute the Kronecker product of two given mulitdimension arrays
9) Condition: NumPy program to compute the condition number of a given matrix 
10) Normal: NumPy program to find a matrix or vector norm
